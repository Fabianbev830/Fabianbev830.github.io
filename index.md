### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

Lab 1, part 1 was a favorite because that was the first lab that I had done at CSUF, and I enjoyed doing it. Also making a friend in that class who I did multiple labs with and we were successful. 

*Lab 4

Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because the code was challenging, and I had fun working it out with my two other partners. Additionally, testing the code was cool since it was a random number generator. 

*Lab 12

Lab 12, part 1 was a favorite because the code was a bit challenging, luckily my partners and I figured it out. Moreover, seeing the image after coding was a bit rewarding in itself.
